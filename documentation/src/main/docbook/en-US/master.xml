    <title>Getting Acquainted with the TCK</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>The Bean Validation TCK must be used to ensure that your
      implementation conforms to the Bean Validation specification. This part
      introduces the TCK, gives some background about its purpose, states the
      requirements for passing the TCK and outlines the appeals process. You
      will also learn where to obtain the Bean Validation TCK and its
      supporting software. You are then presented with recommendations of how
      to organize and configure the software so that you are ready to execute
      the TCK. Finally, it discusses the reporting provided by the TCK.</para>

    <title>Executing and Debugging Tests</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>In this part you learn how to execute the Bean Validation TCK on
      the Bean validation reference implementation (Hibernate Validator). You
      are walked through the steps necessary to execute the test suite against
      Hibernate Validator and you discover how to modify the TCK runner to
      execute the test suite against your own implementation. First, however,
      you learn how to pass the Signature Test.</para>
